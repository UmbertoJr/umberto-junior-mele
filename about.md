I'm a PhD candidate at [IDSIA](http://www.idsia.ch/) (Dalle Molle Institute for Artificial Intelligence) in Switzerland.

My research area is Machine Learning and my aim is to apply it to find neural meta-heuristic algorithms that solves typical Combinatorial Optimization problems, such as Traveling Salesman Problem, Vehicle Routing Problem and Nurse Scheduling Problem.

My master degree is in [Data Science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_science) and I graduated at [Sapienza University](https://www.uniroma1.it/it/pagina-strutturale/home) in Rome.
